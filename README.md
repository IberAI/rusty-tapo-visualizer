# Rusty Topographic Map Visualizer

## Description

Rusty Topographic Map Visualizer is a web application that transforms .tif files into interactive 3D topographic maps. By utilizing a combination of React, TypeScript, and Rust compiled to WebAssembly (WASM), this app reads elevation data from .tif files, generates 3D meshes, and renders them in the browser. This project aims to provide an engaging way to visualize and explore topographic data.

## Technologies

- **React**: Handles the user interface and client-side interactions.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances development by adding static types to JavaScript.
- **Rust**: Used for performance-critical components; compiles to WASM for web use.
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Enables running high-performance Rust code directly in the web browser.
